## Task

I am writing a specification for software "光疗临床路径智能规划系统", I need you to write a detail feature description for all sub features of one of the main features of the software - "AI-driven Personalized Treatment Plans".

{
    "feature": "AI-driven Personalized Treatment Plans",
    "sub_features": [
        "Generates customized light therapy schedules based on individual patient health data",
        "Utilizes advanced AI algorithms to tailor treatment intensity and timing",
        "Incorporates patient history and real-time data for dynamic plan adjustments"
    ],
    "menu_item": "个性化治疗"
}

## Output

Output should be in json format:


{
    "feature": "AI-driven Personalized Treatment Plans",
    "menu_item": "个性化治疗", // menu item name for the main feature
    "feature_detail": "" // detail description of the feature "AI-driven Personalized Treatment Plans" 
    "saas_features": [
        {
            "sub_feature": "Generates customized light therapy schedules based on individual patient health data",
            "title": "", // title of the sub feature
            "description": "" // detailed description of the sub feature, more than 250 characters
        },
        {
            "sub_feature": "Utilizes advanced AI algorithms to tailor treatment intensity and timing",
            "title": "", // title of the sub feature
            "description": "" // detailed description of the sub feature, more than 250 characters
        },
        {
            "sub_feature": "Incorporates patient history and real-time data for dynamic plan adjustments",
            "title": "", // title of the sub feature
            "description": "" // detailed description of the sub feature, more than 250 characters
        }
    ]

  "feature_detail": "The AI-driven Personalized Treatment Plans feature revolutionizes light therapy by leveraging advanced artificial intelligence to design, implement, and continuously refine individualized treatment schedules. By integrating comprehensive patient data—from detailed health records and medical histories to real-time biometric monitoring—this feature ensures that every treatment plan is uniquely optimized to match the patient’s specific physiological needs. Its dynamic and responsive framework allows for constant adjustments in treatment intensity, timing, and scheduling, thereby maximizing therapeutic outcomes while minimizing risks. This holistic approach not only enhances patient safety and comfort but also empowers clinicians with actionable insights, making it a cornerstone of modern, precision-based healthcare.",
  "saas_features": [
    {
      "sub_feature": "Generates customized light therapy schedules based on individual patient health data",
      "title": "Customized Scheduling",
      "description": "This sub-feature meticulously analyzes individual patient health data, including comprehensive medical records, current health metrics, and circadian rhythm patterns, to generate personalized light therapy schedules. The system integrates data from multiple sources such as wearable devices and clinical assessments, ensuring that each treatment session is aligned with the patient’s natural biological cycles. By continuously monitoring these data points, the feature dynamically updates the treatment schedule to reflect any changes in health status or lifestyle, thereby optimizing therapeutic effectiveness and enhancing patient comfort over time."
    },
    {
      "sub_feature": "Utilizes advanced AI algorithms to tailor treatment intensity and timing",
      "title": "Adaptive Intensity Management",
      "description": "Leveraging cutting-edge AI algorithms, this sub-feature processes a wide array of variables including patient sensitivity, light exposure history, and treatment response patterns to fine-tune both the intensity and timing of therapy sessions. The algorithmic models adjust in real time, ensuring that the therapy is calibrated to the patient’s specific physiological responses. This dynamic adjustment not only optimizes the benefits of each session but also mitigates potential risks associated with over- or under-treatment. By continuously learning from incoming data, the system provides a highly personalized and effective treatment regimen that evolves alongside the patient’s health status."
    },
    {
      "sub_feature": "Incorporates patient history and real-time data for dynamic plan adjustments",
      "title": "Real-Time Adaptive Adjustments",
      "description": "This sub-feature integrates historical patient data with real-time health monitoring to allow for continuous and dynamic adjustments to the treatment plan. By analyzing trends and deviations in patient progress, the system is able to promptly modify therapy schedules, treatment intensities, and session timings to better align with the evolving clinical picture. The feedback loop created by this integration not only improves the overall efficacy of the light therapy but also provides clinicians with critical insights for further personalizing care. As a result, patients benefit from a treatment approach that is both responsive and tailored to their unique needs, ensuring optimal safety and improved outcomes."
